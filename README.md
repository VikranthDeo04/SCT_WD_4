JavaScript To-Do App
A simple, modern to-do list web app made with pure JavaScript, HTML, and Bootstrap.
This project mimics the multi-page workflow of a Flask web app—including separate "pages" for adding, editing, and listing tasks—without any backend! All data is stored in the browser.

Features
View all tasks: Task list loads first; shows a friendly “No tasks found” message if empty

Add new tasks with a title, due date/time, and optional description

Edit tasks on a separate page

Mark as complete/undo

Delete tasks

Modern, responsive UI with Bootstrap

Single file, zero dependencies, works entirely offline (uses localStorage)

Instant navigation between "pages" (no reload)

How to Use
Download or Copy
Save the app as index.html (use the code provided in the last assistant answer).

Open in Browser
Double-click or open index.html in any browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.)

Start Managing Tasks

The app loads with the task list view (Task List).

Click “Add New Task” to go to the add page.

Click ✏️ on a task to edit, 🗑️ to delete, and ✔/Undo to mark complete/incomplete.
