# 📝 JavaScript To-Do App

A **simple, modern To-Do list web app** built using **pure JavaScript, HTML, and Bootstrap** — no backend, no frameworks.  
This project simulates a **multi-page workflow** (like Flask or Django apps) but runs entirely on the **frontend** using `localStorage`.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ **View all tasks** — loads existing tasks or shows a friendly “No tasks found” message.  
- ➕ **Add new tasks** — include title, due date/time, and optional description.  
- ✏️ **Edit tasks** — modify task details on a separate “Edit Task” view.  
- ✔️ **Mark complete / Undo** — toggle task status with one click.  
- 🗑️ **Delete tasks** — remove tasks permanently.  
- 💎 **Modern, responsive UI** — styled with Bootstrap for a clean look.  
- ⚡ **Single file, zero dependencies** — works entirely offline using `localStorage`.  
- 🔁 **Instant navigation** — smooth page switching without reloads.

## 🧠 How It Works

This app uses **JavaScript’s `localStorage`** to save and retrieve tasks locally in your browser.  
Each “page” (Task List, Add Task, Edit Task) is dynamically rendered from the same HTML file — no backend required!

## 🧭 How to Use

1. **Download or Copy**  
   - Save the code as `index.html`.

2. **Open in Browser**  
   - Double-click `index.html` or open it in your browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.).

3. **Start Managing Tasks!**  
   - The app starts on the **Task List** view.  
   - Click **“Add New Task”** to create a new task.  
   - Use ✏️ to edit, 🗑️ to delete, and ✔️/Undo to mark tasks complete/incomplete.

## 🌍 Deployment

- 🖥️ **No server required** — works locally as a static file.  
- 🚀 **GitHub Pages:**  
  1. Push `index.html` to your GitHub repo.  
  2. Enable GitHub Pages in your repo settings.  
  3. Your To-Do app is live!
